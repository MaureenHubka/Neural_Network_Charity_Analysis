# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module 19 Challenge
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to use knowledge of machine learning and neural network to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

To do this, Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team has provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.  Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization that can be used to help predict success of applicants.

# Results:

### Data Preprocessing

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
